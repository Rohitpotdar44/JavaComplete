// class = fundamental unit- A class in Java is a blueprint or template used to create objects. It defines the properties and behaviors that the objects will have.e.g. Class: A car blueprint specifies attributes like color, brand, and engine type, and behaviors like start() and stop().

//Object:  An object in Java is a real-world entity created from a class. It represents something with specific properties and actions.e.g.Each car made using the blueprint (e.g., a red Tesla or a blue Toyota) is an object.

// public static void main(String[] args) = main method-entry point of program -it has specific signature (format) - we cannot change format

// public = access modifier -  method accessed from outside of the class 

//static = no object needed to call the method - method belongs to class not any specified object

// void = indicates method that does not return any value

//String args[] = methos accepts array of strings as parameters

//System.out.println("Hello World!"); = print method

// System= class in java.lang pacakage that provide access to system 

//out= instance of print stream

// ;=indiactes end of the statement
