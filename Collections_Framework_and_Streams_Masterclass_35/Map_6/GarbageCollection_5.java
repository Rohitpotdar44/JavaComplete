/*
 Garbage Collection in Java is the process where the JVM automatically removes objects from memory when they are no longer being used or referenced by any part of the program.
This helps free up memory and avoid memory wastage.

ðŸ’¡ Simple Analogy:
Imagine you're renting a locker (memory) to store a bag (object).
If you lose the locker key (reference) and no one else has it, the locker is uselessly occupied.
So, the staff (JVM) will eventually empty the locker to free up space â€” thatâ€™s Garbage Collection!
