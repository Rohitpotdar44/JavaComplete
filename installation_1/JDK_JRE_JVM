JDK-tools and libraies by using this we can write java code (DEBUGGER-COMPILER) JDK CONSISTS JRE
JRE-Provide envirenment to run java programs , JRE CONSISTS JVM
JVM-Finally java program runs in JVM
        Steps-
             1.our file eg. test.java is compiled into byte code by COMPILER
             2.byte code- platform independent (understood by machine only)   
             3.byte code interperate by jvm line by line and result is machine code
             4.machine code- 0 and 1
             5.create one file eg. test.java
             6.write
                    class Test{
                            public static void main(String[] args)
                            {
                                System.out.println("Hello World!");
                            }
                    }
             7.run in cmd - javac test.java (compilation) -.class file created-contains bytecode-only understood by jvm
                            java test  
                            output
             8.interperate line by line means
               parse- 1.to group by instructions 
                      2.to execute instructions line by line                   so interperater is slow than compiler 
          
             9.JUST IN TIME COMPILER - if some funtion is used repetedly then insted of multiple interpretaion it compiled - so interpreter used that compiled code
